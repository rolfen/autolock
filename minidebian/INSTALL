Start with the debian netinst, all packages deselected

Automount: I think udisks2. I tried pmount (need to add a udev rule) and udevil - they're both cool but udisks2 might work best - I think it's the default.

Sound volume: alsamixer

Wifi config: wicd
Note: wicd seems to leave a daemon running, which I don't like. The interface is nice and the software minimal, though.

Terminal: weston-terminal has some issues, high-cpu and artefacts with layout characters (lines etc.)
lxterminal seem to work and not be vulnerable to snooping
gnome-terminal works but I think it might have lots of deps.

Weston:

Firefox right-click bug fix for weston (or wayland):
Copy userChrome.css from ./res to <your firefox profile>/chrome
and weston.ini to ~/.config/
